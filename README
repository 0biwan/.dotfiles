These are my .doftiles cofiguration.

I keep all of them at Dropbox and then create symlinks to the ~ folder

I used multiple other projects to make this one:
* .osx
* .brew
  * were based on was based on https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
* .oh-my-zsh
  * from https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
* setup-sync-sublime-over-dropbox.sh
  * from https://github.com/miohtama/ztanesh/blob/master/zsh-scripts/bin/setup-sync-sublime-over-dropbox.sh


# Requirements:
* Dropbox
* Dotfiles at ~/Dropbox/Dotfiles
* Sublime text 2

# Sugested:
* iTerm2
* use solarized theme for Sublime and for iTerm: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

# Installation:
1. Clone/Fork/copy all files to ~/Dropbox/Dotfiles
2. Run Restore.sh

Suggestions appreciated
